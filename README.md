# CaltechDATA Large Data Pilot

An InvenioRDM instance for the CaltechDATA Pilot.

## Getting started

Set an environment variable with the DataCite test password

```
export INVENIO_RDM_RECORDS_DOI_DATACITE_PASSWORD=
```

We assume you have locally installed dependencies, then

````
invenio-cli install
invenio-cli services setup
```

Run the following commands in order to start your new InvenioRDM instance:

```console
invenio-cli run
```

Once running, visit https://127.0.0.1 in your browser.

**Note**: The server is using a self-signed SSL certificate, so your browser
will issue a warning that you will have to by-pass.
